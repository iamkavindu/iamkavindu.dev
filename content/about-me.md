# About Me

I'm a passionate Software Engineer with a strong focus on backend development. Currently working at **Wiley**, I specialize in building robust, scalable solutions using **Java** and **Spring Boot**.

## What I Do

- Design and implement **microservices architectures** that handle high traffic with reliability
- Build **RESTful APIs** and event-driven systems using modern cloud-native patterns
- Work with **cloud technologies** including AWS and containerized deployments
- Advocate for clean code, test-driven development, and continuous integration

## My Journey

My journey in software engineering has been driven by a curiosity for understanding how systems work at scale. From writing my first lines of Java to architecting distributed systems, every step has deepened my appreciation for elegant, maintainable software.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or writing about software engineering on my blog.
